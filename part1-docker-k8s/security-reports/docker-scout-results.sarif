                "markdown": "> ### Impact\nInitializing a checkboxradio widget on an input enclosed within a label makes that parent label contents considered as the input label. If you call `.checkboxradio( \"refresh\" )` on such a widget and the initial HTML contained encoded HTML entities, they will erroneously get decoded. This can lead to potentially executing JavaScript code.\n\nFor example, starting with the following initial secure HTML:\n```html\n<label>\n\t<input id=\"test-input\">\n\t&lt;img src=x onerror=\"alert(1)\"&gt;\n</label>\n```\nand calling:\n```js\n$( \"#test-input\" ).checkboxradio();\n$( \"#test-input\" ).checkboxradio( \"refresh\" );\n```\nwill turn the initial HTML into:\n```html\n<label>\n\t<!-- some jQuery UI elements -->\n\t<input id=\"test-input\">\n\t<img src=x onerror=\"alert(1)\">\n</label>\n```\nand the alert will get executed.\n\n### Patches\nThe bug has been patched in jQuery UI 1.13.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo remediate the issue, if you can change the initial HTML, you can wrap all the non-input contents of the `label` in a `span`:\n```html\n<label>\n\t<input id=\"test-input\">\n\t<span>&lt;img src=x onerror=\"alert(1)\"&gt;</span>\n</label>\n```\n\n### References\nhttps://blog.jqueryui.com/2022/07/jquery-ui-1-13-2-released/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, search for a relevant issue in [the jQuery UI repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

This is a product of how `rebuild_proxies` is used to recompute and [reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/sessions.py#L319-L328) to requests when redirected. Note this behavior has _only_ been observed to affect proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (e.g. `https://username:password@proxy:8080`).\n\n**Current vulnerable behavior(s):**\n\n1. HTTP → HTTPS: **leak**\n2. HTTPS → HTTP: **no leak**\n3. HTTPS → HTTPS: **leak**\n4. HTTP → HTTP: **no leak**\n\nFor HTTP connections sent through the proxy, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into further tunneled requests. This results in Requests forwarding the header to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate those credentials.\n\nThe reason this currently works for HTTPS connections in Requests is the `Proxy-Authorization` header is also handled by urllib3 with our usage of the ProxyManager in adapters.py with [`proxy_manager_for`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/adapters.py#L199-L235). This will compute the required proxy headers in `proxy_headers` and pass them to the Proxy Manager, avoiding attaching them directly to the Request object. This will be our preferred option going forward for default usage.\n\n### Patches\nStarting in Requests v2.31.0, Requests will no longer attach this header to redirects with an HTTPS destination. This should have no negative impacts on the default behavior of the library as the proxy credentials are already properly being handled by urllib3's ProxyManager.\n\nFor users with custom adapters, this _may_ be potentially breaking if you were already working around this behavior. The previous functionality of `rebuild_proxies` doesn't make sense in any case, so we would encourage any users impacted to migrate any handling of Proxy-Authorization directly into their custom adapter.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor users who are not able to update Requests immediately, there is one potential workaround.\n\nYou may disable redirects by setting `allow_redirects` to `False` on all calls through Requests top-level APIs. Note that if you're currently relying on redirect behaviors, you will need to capture the 3xx response codes and ensure a new request is made to the redirect destination.\n```\nimport requests\nr = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)\n```\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by the following individuals.\n\nDennis Brinkrolf, Haxolot (https://haxolot.com/)\nTobias Funke, (tobiasfunke93@gmail.com)\n",

In the past, differences in the handling of such whitespace have led to security vulnerabilities in request routing and response handling. A server MUST reject, with a response status code of 400 (Bad Request), any received request message that contains whitespace between a header field name and colon.\n\nAIOHTTP does not enforce this rule, and will simply strip any whitespace before the colon in an HTTP header.\n\n### Example\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nContent-Length : 1\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\nX\n```\n\n### Suggested action\nReject all messages with whitespace before a colon in a header field, as the standard requires.\n\n# PoC\nExample requests are embedded in the previous section.
